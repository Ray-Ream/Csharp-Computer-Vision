### Getting Started
These projects are written in C#.


###### Development configuration requirements
1. **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 (Community / Professional / Enterprise editions are all supported)  
2. **.NET Framework:** 4.8 or higher, or .NET 6+ for modern C# projects  
3. **UI Framework:** Windows Forms  
4. **NuGet Packages / Libraries (if applicable):**  
   - `System.Drawing.Common` (for image manipulation)  
   - `Accord.NET` or `Emgu CV` (optional, for advanced computer vision support)  
5. **Operating System:** Windows 10 or above  
6. **Hardware:** Standard development PC; GPU acceleration is optional for intensive image processing
